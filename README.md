Work Hours Tracker — your all-in-one Android companion for logging, visualizing and maximizing your work time:

• Projects & Jobs
Create unlimited jobs or projects and switch instantly to keep all your time entries organized.

• Daily Time Logging
Tap the calendar, pick a date and record hours worked, break time, shift type (morning/day/night) and holidays. Revisit any date to edit or delete your previous entry.

• Flexible Bonus & Rate Settings
Set a base hourly rate plus custom bonuses for nights, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. All rates are stored per job, so you never have to re-enter them.

• Rich Statistics & Charts
Switch between year-view (12-month trend) and month-view (day-by-day breakdown) to see your total hours, days worked, shift counts, weekends, holidays—and exactly how much you earned (base pay + bonuses). Interactive line and bar charts bring your data to life.

• CSV Export & Sharing
Generate and share a CSV of all entries for any job via email, messaging or cloud storage.

Under the hood:
• Room + Room Auto-Migrations for reliable local storage
• Kotlin Coroutines & Flow for smooth, asynchronous data flows
• ViewModel + LiveData for lifecycle-aware UI updates
• Navigation Component + SafeArgs for seamless, type-safe screen transitions
• MPAndroidChart for beautiful, responsive charts

Whether you’re billing clients, managing multiple gigs or simply curious about your work habits, Work Hours Tracker puts the power of your time—and earnings—at your fingertips.
