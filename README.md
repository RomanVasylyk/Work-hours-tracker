Work Hours Tracker is a lightweight Android app designed to help you log, visualize and manage your work time across multiple projects. With a clean Material 3 interface and intuitive navigation, you can:

Organize by job or project
Create any number of “jobs” (projects or clients) and switch between them to keep your time entries neatly grouped.

Log daily entries
Tap a custom calendar dialog to pick a date, then enter hours worked, break time, shift type (morning/day/night) and mark holidays. If you revisit a date that already has an entry, the form pre-loads your previous data for easy editing or deletion.

Review detailed statistics
View per-month summaries showing total hours, days worked, breakdown by shift type, weekend days and holidays. Quickly switch between years and months using dropdowns.

Export your data
Generate a CSV file of all entries for a job and share it via your favorite apps or cloud storage.

Under the hood, Work Hours Tracker uses Room for a robust local database, Kotlin Coroutines & Flow for asynchronous data loading, ViewModel + LiveData for lifecycle-safe UI updates, and the Navigation Component with SafeArgs for seamless screen transitions. Whether you’re a freelancer tracking billable hours or just want to understand your work patterns, Work Hours Tracker gives you full control over your time.
